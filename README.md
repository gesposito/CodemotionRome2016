This repository contains code for my [Codemotion Rome 2016 Conference](http://rome2016.codemotionworld.com/conference/) App (mostly a proof of concept).

```
// TBD
Here is the final result:
* <a href="">
Google Play
</a>
* <a href="">
App Store
</a>
```

## How to install
You need [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) properly setup either for iOS, Android, or both.

Then, inside this project:

`npm install`

## How to run

**To run the iOS app:**

- `react-native run-ios`

**To run the Android app:**

- `react-native run-android`
